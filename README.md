# Social-media
This repository contains a social networking project developed using Spring Boot for backend microservices and React with JavaScript for the frontend. The microservices include a login service, a profile service allowing users to post statuses, interact with posts, manage their profiles, and a messaging service for user communications. Firebase has been integrated for authentication management. The project aims to showcase microservices architecture and fundamental social networking features. You will find a use case diagram illustrating key interactions between users and the application.
